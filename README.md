# CalculatorMVCJava
Program made for the last object-oriented programming exam in the second period of computer science. It's basicaly a calculator.
I used the language Java and the MVC pattern.
To build this programm I used the concepts of interface, class, exception handling, serialization. And of course all the program are build using the object-oriented programming principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
